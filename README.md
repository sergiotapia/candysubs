# Candysub

Candysub is a command-line program to download subtitles for all of your media,
whether it's TV or Movies.

## Usage

```
./candysub --path=test_files/Mission\ Impossible\ 4\ Ghost\ Protocol\ 2011\ BluRay\ Bdrip\ x264\ 1080p\ 720p.mkv
```

Candysub will download the subtitle for your media file and rename it so it's
the same name as your media.

```
Mission Impossible 4 Ghost Protocol 2011 BluRay Bdrip x264 1080p 720p.mkv
Mission Impossible 4 Ghost Protocol 2011 BluRay Bdrip x264 1080p 720p.srt
```

## Installation

Work in progress, I'll probably configure something with distillery to allow
single file deploys.

## Wishlist

- [ ] Folders as param - process folders recursively for all media files.
